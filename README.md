Hello,

I'm Laxmi Gurung, currently studying Software Development at Trios College. 
I just love technology! It's like this amazing puzzle that I'm always excited to solve. 
I'm constantly learning new things to get better at it. 

Here on GitHub, you'll find the projeccts I've been working on. From school assigments to 
personal experiments, each one is a step forward in my learning journey.
